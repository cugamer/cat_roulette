Cat Roulette
============

This is the worlds first (to my knowledge anyway) game which  displays a spinning assortment of random cat pictures.  It's built in Ruby on Rails and uses the [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) api to grab random images from that site.  There is no persistence with the program at this time.  The carosuel effect is achieved using a JavaScript library called [Flipster](https://github.com/drien/jquery-flipster).  The application is live and can be viewed [here](http://play-cat-roulette.herokuapp.com/).
